<!-- Project Idea: “Array Playground”

Step 1: Start with an array

Example:

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];

Step 2: Pop and Push

Pop: Remove the last element and log the array.

Push: Add a new number and log the array.

Step 3: Shift and Unshift

Shift: Remove the first element and log the array.

Unshift: Add a new number at the beginning and log the array.

Step 4: forEach

Loop through the array and print each number multiplied by 2.

Step 5: map

Create a new array where each number is squared.

Print the new array.

Step 6: filter

Create a new array containing only even numbers.

Print it.

Step 7: reduce

Calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.

Print the sum.

Step 8: some

Check if the array contains any number greater than 10.

Print true or false.

Step 9: every

Check if all numbers are positive.

Print true or false.

Step 10: sort

Sort the array in ascending order and log it.

Then sort in descending order and log it.

Step 11: find

Find the first number greater than 4 and print it.

Step 12: findIndex

Find the index of the first number greater than 4 and print it.

Step 13: concat

Concatenate the original array with another array (e.g., [8, 9, 10]) and print the result.

Step 14: flat

Start with a nested array, e.g., [1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]].

Flatten it using flat() and log the result.

Step 15: flatMap

Start with an array, e.g., [1, 2, 3].

For each element, return an array with the number and its square.

Use flatMap() to create a single flattened array and log it.
