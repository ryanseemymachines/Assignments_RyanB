<!-- Project Idea: “Array Playground”

You’ll have an array of numbers, and for each method, you’ll manipulate or analyze the array and print results to the console.

Steps to follow:

Start with an array

Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Pop and Push

Remove the last element (pop) and log the array.

Add a new number (push) and log again.

forEach

Loop through the array and print each number multiplied by 2.

map

Create a new array where each number is squared.

Print the new array.

filter

Create a new array containing only even numbers.

Print it.

reduce

Calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.

Print the sum.

some

Check if the array contains any number greater than 10.

Print true or false.

every

Check if all numbers are positive.

Print true or false.

Extra Challenge (optional)

Ask the user to input a number and check if it exists in the array using some.

Remove numbers smaller than a certain threshold using filter.
