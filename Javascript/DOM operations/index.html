1️⃣ Selecting Elements

Task Steps:

Create an HTML page containing:

A <div> with an id of container.

A few <p> elements inside the container (each with a unique class name or text).

A button with an id of actionBtn.

In your JavaScript file:

Use getElementById() to select the container and log it to the console.

Use querySelector() to select the first <p> element inside the container and log it.

Use querySelectorAll() to select all <p> elements and loop through them to print their text content.

2️⃣ Modifying Elements

Task Steps:

Select one of the <p> elements and:

Change its text using innerHTML.

Change another paragraph’s text using textContent.

Add a CSS class (like "highlight") using classList.add().

Remove a class using classList.remove().

Add an attribute (like title="Information paragraph") using setAttribute().

Remove an attribute (like title) using removeAttribute().

3️⃣ Creating and Appending Elements

Task Steps:

Use document.createElement() to create a new <p> element.

Set its text using either innerHTML or textContent.

Append the new paragraph inside the container using appendChild().

Create another new element (like a <span>) and insert it before the newly added paragraph using insertBefore().

4️⃣ Event Handling

Task Steps:

Select the button with id actionBtn.

Use addEventListener() to attach a click event that:

Changes the background color of the container.

Displays a message in the console like "Button clicked!".

Add another event listener (like mouseover) that changes the text color of all <p> elements.

Demonstrate removeEventListener() by removing one of the event listeners after it runs once (e.g., after a second click).

5️⃣ Traversing the DOM

Task Steps:

Select the container and explore its structure:

Print its parentNode to the console.

Print its childNodes, firstChild, and lastChild.

Use nextSibling and previousSibling on one of the paragraphs to move through the DOM tree.

Observe the differences between nodes (like text nodes vs element nodes) and log them to the console.

6️⃣ Bonus Challenge (Optional)

Combine everything above:

When the user clicks the button:

A new paragraph should be created and appended to the container.

The new paragraph should have a specific class added.

The button should temporarily change its text or style.

Log the updated DOM structure to verify changes.
