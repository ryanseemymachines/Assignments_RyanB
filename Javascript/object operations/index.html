<!-- Object Creation and Iteration:

Create an object called student with at least 4 key-value pairs, e.g., name, age, grade, city.

Use Object.keys() to print all the keys of the student object.

Use Object.values() to print all the values of the student object.

Use Object.entries() to print all key-value pairs of the student object in array format.

Use a for...of loop to iterate through the entries and print them in a readable format like: "Key: <key>, Value: <value>".

Object Copying and Merging:

Create another object called additionalInfo with at least 2 key-value pairs, e.g., hobby, school.

Use Object.assign() to:

Make a shallow copy of the student object into a new object called studentCopy.

Merge student and additionalInfo into a new object called fullStudentProfile.

Print all the resulting objects to verify that copying and merging worked correctly.

Object Immutability Methods:

Create an object named userProfile with at least three key-value pairs (for example: name, age, email).

Print the original userProfile object to verify its contents.

Step 2: Demonstrate Object.freeze()

Create a copy of userProfile and store it in a new variable (e.g., frozenUser).

Apply Object.freeze() on this copy.

Try to modify one of the existing properties (e.g., change the name).

Try to add a new property (e.g., add a phone number).

Try to delete one of the existing properties (e.g., delete the email).

Print the object after each attempt to see whether the changes occurred or not.

Optionally, use Object.isFrozen() to verify if the object is frozen and print the result.

Step 3: Demonstrate Object.seal()

Create another copy of userProfile (e.g., sealedUser).

Apply Object.seal() on this copy.

Try to modify one of the existing properties.

Try to add a new property.

Try to delete one of the existing properties.

Print the object after each operation to observe what was allowed and what was blocked.

Optionally, check the status using Object.isSealed() and print the result.

Step 4: Demonstrate Object.preventExtensions()

Create another copy of userProfile (e.g., nonExtensibleUser).

Apply Object.preventExtensions() on this copy.

Try to add a new property (e.g., address).

Try to modify an existing property.

Try to delete a property.

Print the object after each operation to verify which ones were successful.

Optionally, check whether the object is extensible using Object.isExtensible() and print the result. -->
